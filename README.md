Hi, I’m Riya Mehta.

I’m a B.Tech Computer Engineering student with an interest in building practical, data-driven applications. I enjoy working on Python-based systems, exploring recommendation logic, and structuring projects that solve real-world problems.

Currently, I’m focused on strengthening my foundations in software development while experimenting with data analysis and intelligent systems.

## Projects

### 1. AI/ML-Based Resume Analysis and Job Recommendation System
Developed an AI/ML-based system using Python that analyzes resumes and recommends suitable job roles based on textual content. The project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract meaningful information from resumes and match them with relevant job domains.

Key highlights:
- NLP-based text preprocessing and analysis
- Resume content understanding using keyword and pattern extraction
- Job role recommendation based on extracted features
- Implemented and tested entirely using Python in Cursor

This project strengthened my understanding of applied NLP, machine learning workflows, and real-world problem formulation.

### 2. Car Recommendation System
Built a Python-based command-line application that recommends cars based on user preferences such as budget, brand, fuel type, transmission, body type, and seating capacity. The system processes a structured dataset, applies preference-based filtering, and ranks results using a match score to indicate relevance.

Key highlights:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using pandas
- Menu-driven user interaction
- Match score–based recommendation ranking
- Side-by-side comparison of two car models

### 3. API-Based Text-to-Image Generation System
Developed a system that integrates third-party text-to-image generation APIs to generate images based on user prompts. The project focused on prompt structuring, API integration, and handling dynamic user inputs such as model selection and output preferences.

Key highlights:
- Integration of external AI APIs
- Prompt engineering for improved image outputs
- Handling user-defined parameters and responses
- Understanding end-to-end AI service workflows
